Things to add or improve:
-------------------------
- Make right-click on playlist for file info work. Best if this also shows some basic
  file details, where appropriate (metadata - bitrate, artist, album, track number, track
  name, modified date, etc.)
- Support AlbumArtSmall.jpg in addition to Folder.jpg for album art.
- Disable all qDebug statements.
- Add support for FLAC.
- Add support for Speex.
- Test 8-bit, 32-bit, and mono versions of file formats because we're probably not
  handling some of them properly. Ogg, wavpack, and wave most likely don't work in
  32-bit and wavpack most likely doesn't work in 8-bit mono, but this is unverified.
- Allow user to configer interface colors and/or modify/skin the interface.
- Add support for loading playlists (m3u, etc.).
- Add support for displaying and editing ID3 tags (via playlist right-click).
